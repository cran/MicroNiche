Description: Measures niche breadth and overlap of microbial taxa from large matrices.
			Niche breadth measurements include Levins' niche breadth (Bn) index, Hurlbert's Bn 
			and Feinsinger's proportional similarity (PS) index. (Feinsinger, P., Spears, E.E.,
			Poole, R.W. (1981) <doi:10.2307/1936664>). Niche overlap measurements include 
			Levin's Overlap (Ludwig, J.A. and Reynolds, J.F. (1988, ISBN:0471832359)) and a Jaccard 
			similarity index of Feinsinger's PS values between taxa pairs, as Proportional Overlap.
